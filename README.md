## Introduction

- The **Hello World** project Training is hosted by **Shreya Malogi** , is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new. Let’s get started with GitHub! 🌐

- By the end of this training, you will be able to make your own Codecosmers rep0,

- **P.S** : CodeCosmers are the Stakeholders in Codemacrocosm
  
- Enjoy your journey into GitHub! 🚀✨

## You’ll learn how to 

- Create and use a repository 📁
- Start and manage a new branch 🌿
- Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits 💻
- Open and merge a pull request 🔄

## What is GitHub? 🤔

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. 🌍

This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like _repositories_, _branches_, _commits_, and _Pull Requests_. You’ll create your own Hello CodeCosmers repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code. 📝

## No coding necessary 🚫

To complete this tutorial, you need a [GitHub.com account](http://github.com) and Internet access. You don’t need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software GitHub is built on). 🌐

> **Tip:** Open this guide in a separate browser window (or tab) so you can see it while you complete the steps in the tutorial. 🌟

## Step 1\. Create a Repository 🚀

A **repository** is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a _README_, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. 📁

Your `hello-CodeCosmers` repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others. 🤝

-  To create a new repository 🌟

1. In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click <span class="octicon octicon-plus"></span>and then select **New repository**. 📅
2. Name your repository `hello-CodeCosmers`. 🌐
3. Write a short description. 📝
4. Select **Initialize this repository with a README**. 📂

Click **Create repository**. 🚀

## Step 2\. Create a Branch 🌿

**Branching** is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time. 🔄

- By default, your repository has one branch named `master` which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to `master`. 🎨

- When you create a branch off the `master` branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of `master` as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the `master` branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates. 🔄

- This diagram shows:

- The `master` branch 🌟
- A new branch called `feature` (because we’re doing ‘feature work’ on this branch) 🌟
- The journey that `feature` takes before it’s merged into `master` 🌟

![a branch](/images/branching.png) 🌿

Have you ever saved different versions of a file? Something like:

- `story.txt` 📖
- `story-shreya-edit.txt` ✏️
- `story-shreya-edit-reviewed.txt` 📝

Branches accomplish similar goals in GitHub repositories. 🌟

- Here at GitHub, our developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our `master` (production) branch. When a change is ready, they merge their branch into `master`. 🤝

- To create a new branch 🌿

1. Go to your new repository `hello-CodeCosmers`. 🚀
2. Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says **branch: master**. 🌿
3. Type a branch name, `readme-edits`, into the new branch text box. 📝
4. Select the blue **Create branch** box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard. 🚀

![branch gif](/images/readme-edits.gif) 🌟

- Now you have two branches, `master` and `readme-edits`. They look exactly the same, but not for long! Next, we’ll add our changes to the new branch. 🌟

---

#### Step 3\. Make and commit changes 📝

- Bravo! Now, you’re on the code view for your `readme-edits` branch, which is a copy of `master`. Let’s make some edits. 💻

- On GitHub, saved changes are called _commits_. Each commit has an associated _commit message_, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why. 📜

 - Make and commit changes 📝

- 1. Click the `README.md` file. 📖
     
- 2. Click the <span class="octicon octicon-pencil"></span>pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit. ✏️
     
- 3. In the editor, write a bit about yourself. 🤖
     
- 4. Write a commit message that describes your changes. 📝
     
- 5. Click **Commit changes** button. 🚀

![commit](/images/commit.png) 🌟

- These changes will be made to just the README file on your `readme-edits` branch, so now this branch contains content that’s different from `master`. 🌟

---

## Step 4\. Open a Pull Request 🔄

- Nice edits! Now that you have changes in a branch off of `master`, you can open a _pull request_. 🌟

- Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a _pull request_, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show _diffs_, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red. 🌟

- As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished. 🌟

- By using GitHub’s [@mention system](https://help.github.com/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github/#text-formatting-toolbar) in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away. 🌟

You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It’s a great way to learn the GitHub Flow before working on larger projects. 🌟

-  Open a Pull Request for changes to the README 📜

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Click the **Pull Request** tab, then from the Pull Request page, click the green **New pull request** button.            | [![pr-tab](/images/pr-tab.gif)](pr-tab.gif)            |
| In the **Example Comparisons** box, select the branch you made, `readme-edits`, to compare with `master` (the original). | [![branch](/images/pick-branch.png)](pick-branch.png)  |
| Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they’re what you want to submit.                      | [![diff](/images/diff.png)](diff.png)                  |
| When you’re satisfied that these are the changes you want to submit, click the big green **Create Pull Request** button. | [![create-pull](/images/create-pr.png)](create-pr.png) |
| Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes.                                            | [![pr-form](/images/pr-form.png)](pr-form.png)         |

- When you’re done with your message, click **Create pull request**! 🌟

---

> **Tip**: You can use [emoji](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#using-emoji) and [drag and drop images and gifs](https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests/) onto comments and Pull Requests. 🌟

---

## Step 5\. Merge your Pull Request 🚀



- In this final step, it’s time to bring your changes together – merging your `readme-edits` branch into the `master` branch. 🌟

1. Click the green **Merge pull request** button to merge the changes into `master`. 🔄
2. Click **Confirm merge**. 🌟
3. Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, with the **Delete branch** button in the purple box. ❌
